# Simple_Calculator
Here I have created a GUI-based simple calculator using the Python Tkinter module, which can perform basic arithmetic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Python offers multiple options for developing a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI methods, Tkinter is the most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with Tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way to create GUI applications. Creating a GUI using Tkinter is an easy task.
To create a this application do following steps -:
1. Importing the module â€“ tkinter
2. Create the main window (container)
3. Add any number of widgets to the main window
4. Apply the event Trigger on the widgets.

This calculator can perform tasks very well but have some drawbacks also . It doesn't have any memory/storage concept. So after performing a task it will simply clear all. If you try to do operation with the answer you have it will thorw an error message to you. It has no bracket button but it always follows associativity and precedence.
